1- Primitive type: the basic data tipes like string, number or boolean. Stored in Stack and the value can be directly copied.

- Reference type: the value is stored as a reference using pointers in the memory, it can't be directly copied as when you copy it you copy the refrence not the actual value.


2- Function declaration: it's a Function with the function keyword followed by its name, hosisting means it can be defined before its decleration,
ex: 
add(4,5);

function add(x, y){
    console.log(x + y);
}

- Function expression: assign a function to a variable, only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function declaration.
ex:
add(4,5); --> not a function "error"

const add = function(x, y){
    console.log(x + y);
}


3- Pure Function --> is a deterministic function, the output is always the same given the same input and dosen't depend on any other variables.
